# Notes to Dalton:
Probably the most useful thing you'll get out of this is in consul/consul_vault_setup/ . It contains the setup 
script for vault and consul I found, along with the notes on what I changed and how I set it up in that same directory.
DISCLAIMER: For all of these notes, I wrote them knowing they were going to be read mostly for Dalton, so I might  have assumed some 
knowledge here or there on things that I know he's familiar with.

## Directory Breakdown
* Consul
This directory contains everything I was working on towards the end of the semester, along with the vault and consul install/setup scripts

* Keymanage
This is just a compare/contrast of the different key managers I was reviewing, with a different directory for each one. 
idk why i structured it like that but ok

* kubernetes
I worked on kubernetes a lot in the first half of the semester, and I probably set up like 9 clusters manually before wising up
and writing these install scripts to make my life easier. 

* vault
tbh I dont trust the setup instructions in this directory. Probably most helpful for seeing what environment variables you might be
forgetting/might be helpful, or just sample config files. I find it highly likely that I had no clue what I was doing when I wrote the setup

first_task is just a list of notes I wrote myself for each of the tasks you gave me on Trello on day 1. Included this just for
thoroughness, but it has some tutorials you might find helpful. 
serviceMeshes is just a super short and sweet, high-level and excessively vague comparison of the service meshes we talked about,
most likely based on the results of a single google search
